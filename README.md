IRM PROJECT - TURTLEBOT3 NAVIGATION in closed environment

simulation of the environment
autonomous navigation and mapping w/ slam
autonomous exploration using the map
autonomous navigation following a specific rule (UV irradiation on walls)


possible variation:
	navigation node/routine always reads a topic relative to goal
	goal is set by user OR exploration node
